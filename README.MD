# Fetch Rewards Coding Challange

This coding exercise was my first time using both go and docker. I wanted to use your preferred language on this coding exercise even though I had not used it to show that I am capable and eager to learn these new technologies. 

## Installation

My project should run via standard docker image creation

```bash
  docker build -t vdimaggio-exercise
  docker run -it -p 8081:8081 vdimaggio-exercise
```
